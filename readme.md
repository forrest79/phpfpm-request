Simply utility to make `php-fpm` requests right from command line with no needs to set up your web server for these requests.


## Installation

The recommended way to install Forrest79/PhpFpmRequest is through Composer:

```sh
composer require forrest79/phpfpm-request
```

This also needs `cgi-fcgi` installed on your system. On Debian (Ubuntu...) like linux, you can do this:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libfcgi0ldbl
```

You can you this to clear some caches from cli that need to be called via HTTP request (opcache, apcu, ...) or to warm up your cache after a new version is deployed and before web server is started to point to new source code.


## How to use it

We just need to know, where is `php-fpm` listening. It's config directive `listen` and it could be `socket` or `TCP\IP`.
In `nginx` it's directive `fastcgi_pass`. If you don't know that, or you're planning to run this on different systems, you can try to autodetect this:

```php
$requester = Forrest79\PhpFpmRequest\Requester::autodetect();
```

Or if you know where `php-fpm` is listening, you can use this value:

```php
$requester = Forrest79\PhpFpmRequest\Requester::create('/var/run/php/php7.4-fpm.sock');
```

Now just simple set PHP file to process with `php-fpm`:

```php
$requester->setPhpFile('/var/www/index.php');
```

And send the request:

```php
$response = $requester->send();
```

Now we have `Response` object, that can return `array` of `HTTP` headers and text body.

```php
echo $reponse->getBody() . PHP_EOL;

foreach ($response->getHeaders() as $header) {
    echo $header . PHP_EOL;
}
```

If you need to pass more options to `php-fpm`, just use `setOption(string $name, string $value)` method. Only `REQUEST_METHOD` is set automatically to `GET` and `SCRIPT_FILENAME` is pass. But you can add anything you want:

```php
$requester
    ->setOption('QUERY_STRING', '?param=1')
    ->setOption('SERVER_NAME', 'my-server.com')
    ->setOption('REQUEST_URI', '/show-detail/');
```

If you need better API for this, extends `Requester` with your own class and create better public API and in every method just call `parent::setOption('...', '...')`.


### Cli and php-fpm in one file

You can have `cli` and `php-fpm` source code in one file:

```php
if (PHP_SAPI === 'cli') {
    echo Forrest79\PhpFpmRequest\Requester::autodetect()
        ->setPhpFile(__FILE__)
        ->send()
        ->getBody() . PHP_EOL;
} else {
    echo 'This code is processed with php-fpm. You can warm up your cache here, clean cache, etc.';
}
```
